Metformin is a widely used oral medication primarily prescribed for the management of **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**. It belongs to a class of drugs called **biguanides**.

Here's a breakdown of key information about Metformin:

1.  **Primary Use:**
    *   **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** It is often the first-line medication prescribed for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes, especially in individuals who are overweight or obese.

2.  **How it Works (Mechanism of Action):** Metformin works through several mechanisms to lower blood glucose levels:
    *   **Decreases Hepatic Glucose Production:** Its primary action is to reduce the amount of glucose produced by the liver (gluconeogenesis).
    *   **Increases Insulin Sensitivity:** It improves the body's sensitivity to insulin, allowing cells (especially in muscles and fat) to take up glucose more effectively from the blood.
    *   **Decreases Glucose Absorption:** It may also slightly decrease the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract.
    *   **Important Note:** Unlike some other diabetes medications, Metformin does *not* stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which means it has a very low risk of causing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when used alone.

3.  **Benefits:**
    *   **Effective Blood Sugar Control:** Significantly lowers HbA1c levels.
    *   **Weight Neutral or Modest Weight Loss:** Unlike many other diabetes medications that can cause weight gain, Metformin is often weight-neutral or can lead to a modest amount of weight loss.
    *   **Low Risk of Hypoglycemia:** When used as monotherapy.
    *   **Potential Cardiovascular Benefits:** Some studies suggest it may have protective effects on the cardiovascular system.
    *   **Inexpensive:** Generally an affordable medication.

4.  **Dosage and Administration:**
    *   Metformin is usually started at a low dose and gradually increased to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
    *   It is typically taken with meals to further reduce GI upset.
    *   It comes in immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) formulations.

5.  **Common Side Effects:**
    *   **Gastrointestinal Issues:** These are the most common side effects and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a metallic taste in the mouth. These often improve over time as the body adjusts to the medication. Taking it with food and starting with a low dose helps.
    *   **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:** Long-term use of Metformin can sometimes lead to a decrease in vitamin B12 levels. Regular monitoring and supplementation may be necessary.

6.  **Serious (but Rare) Side Effect: Lactic Acidosis:**
    *   This is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition where there is a buildup of lactic acid in the blood.
    *   **Risk Factors:** It is more likely to occur in individuals with impaired kidney function, liver disease, heart failure, severe dehydration, excessive alcohol intake, or during acute illness.
    *   **Symptoms:** Muscle pain, weakness, unusual tiredness, trouble breathing, stomach pain, dizziness, and a slow or irregular heartbeat. **If these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is required.**

7.  **Important Considerations and Warnings:**
    *   **Kidney Function:** Metformin is primarily cleared by the kidneys. It is contraindicated or requires dose adjustment in individuals with significant kidney impairment (low eGFR) due to the increased risk of lactic acidosis.
    *   **Liver Disease:** Should be used with caution or avoided in severe liver disease.
    *   **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking Metformin, as it can increase the risk of lactic acidosis.
    *   **Iodinated Contrast Procedures:** Metformin may need to be temporarily discontinued before and after certain imaging procedures involving iodinated contrast dyes, due to the risk of acute kidney injury and subsequent lactic acidosis.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood glucose, HbA1c, kidney function (eGFR), and sometimes vitamin B12 levels is important.

8.  **Off-Label Uses:**
    *   **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS):** Metformin is often prescribed off-label for women with PCOS, particularly those with insulin resistance, to help regulate menstrual cycles, improve fertility, and manage weight.
    *   **Prediabetes:** In some cases, Metformin may be prescribed to individuals with prediabetes who are at high risk of progressing to Type 2 diabetes (e.g., those with a history of gestational diabetes, significant obesity, or a strong family history).
