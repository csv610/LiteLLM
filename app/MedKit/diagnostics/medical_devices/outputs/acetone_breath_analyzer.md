**Medical Device Information: Acetone Breath Analyzer**

**1. Device Name and Classification:**

*   **Device Name:** Acetone Breath Analyzer (also referred to as Ketone Breath Test Device, KBTD)
*   **Classification (US FDA):** Typically Class 2 (unmetered) or Class B (metered) depending on the specific design and intended use.  Higher-end, laboratory-grade models may be classified as Class A (metered) if they meet stringent accuracy requirements.
*   **CE Marking:**  Generally classified as Medical Device Class IIa according to the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745.
*   **Other Regulatory Considerations:**  Manufacturers must comply with relevant local regulations regarding medical device marketing and sales.



**2. Intended Use and Applications:**

*   **Primary Intended Use:**  Quantitative measurement of acetone levels in exhaled breath.
*   **Applications:**
    *   **Diabetes Management:** Monitoring ketosis in individuals with Type 1 diabetes (especially during periods of low insulin) and potentially Type 2 diabetes for early detection of ketoacidosis.
    *   **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Screening:** Rapid screening for DKA in emergency settings or at home for proactive monitoring.
    *   **Nutritional Monitoring:** Assessing ketone levels in individuals following ketogenic diets.
    *   **Research:** Investigating metabolic pathways and physiological responses to various conditions.



**3. Technical Specifications and Principles:**

*   **Principle of Operation:** Non-invasive measurement of acetone concentration in exhaled breath via infrared (IR) spectroscopy.  The device emits infrared light through the mouthpiece, and the amount of light absorbed by acetone molecules is proportional to the acetone concentration.
*   **Wavelength:** Typically utilizes wavelengths around 660-770 nm for acetone detection.
*   **Sensitivity:**  Ranges vary widely. Consumer models typically offer readings down to 0.5 mmol/L or 0.8 mmol/L. Clinical models can achieve lower limits of detection (e.g., 0.2 mmol/L or lower).
*   **Accuracy:** Clinical models typically have an accuracy of ±10-20% within the measurement range, depending on calibration and environmental factors.
*   **Resolution:**  Typically 0.1 mmol/L or 0.2 mmol/L.



**4. Physical Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions:**  Consumer models: Approximately 15cm (L) x 8cm (W) x 6cm (H). Clinical models: Variable, ranging from portable handheld units to benchtop analyzers.
*   **Weight:** Consumer models: Approximately 200-300g. Clinical models: 1-10kg depending on size and features.
*   **Materials:**  Housing: Plastic (ABS, polycarbonate), Mouthpiece: Silicone, Sensor: IR emitter/detector.
*   **Power Source:**  Consumer models: Battery-powered (AAA or AA). Clinical models: AC adapter or battery.

**5. Operational Requirements and Specifications:**

*   **Calibration:** Regular calibration is crucial (typically monthly or as recommended by the manufacturer).  Calibration uses a standard acetone solution of known concentration.
*   **Warm-up Time:**  Typically 5-10 minutes for clinical models to stabilize.
*   **Measurement Time:**  Approximately 10-30 seconds per reading.
*   **Data Storage:**  Many models store a history of measurements.
*   **Display:** LCD screen displaying acetone concentration in mmol/L or mg/dL, along with unit indicators and error messages.



**6. Safety and Regulatory Information:**

*   **Biohazard Considerations:**  The device itself poses minimal biohazard risk. However, proper disposal of used collection devices (e.g., breath collection tubes) is essential.
*   **Electrical Safety:** Complies with relevant electrical safety standards (e.g., IEC 60601).
*   **Radiation Safety:**  Infrared light used is within safe exposure limits.
*   **FDA Clearance/CE Marking:**  As noted above, confirmation of clearance/marking is critical for sale and use.



**7. Clinical Applications and Benefits:**

*   **Early DKA Detection:** Allows for rapid identification of DKA, enabling timely intervention and potentially preventing serious complications.
*   **Personalized Diabetes Management:**  Provides patients with real-time feedback on their metabolic state, promoting self-management and adherence to treatment plans.
*   **Keto Diet Monitoring:**  Helps individuals track their ketone levels during ketogenic diets, optimizing nutritional intake.
*   **Reduced Healthcare Costs:**  Early detection and proactive management can potentially reduce hospitalizations and complications associated with DKA.

**8. Maintenance and Servicing Requirements:**

*   **Cleaning:** Regular cleaning of the mouthpiece and exterior surfaces with a mild disinfectant.
*   **Battery Replacement:**  Replace batteries as needed.
*   **Calibration:**  Perform calibration according to manufacturer’s instructions (typically monthly).
*   **Sensor Maintenance:**  Follow manufacturer’s recommendations for sensor cleaning or replacement (if applicable).
*   **Professional Servicing:**  Periodic servicing by qualified technicians is recommended, especially for clinical models.



**9. Cost and Availability Information:**

*   **Consumer Models:**  $50 - $200
*   **Clinical Models:** $500 - $5,000+ (depending on features and accuracy)
*   **Availability:**  Available through medical device distributors and online retailers.

**10. Advantages and Limitations:**

*   **Advantages:**
    *   Non-invasive and convenient.
    *   Rapid measurement.
    *   Potential for early DKA detection.
    *   Supports patient self-management.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Accuracy can be affected by factors such as hydration status, recent meals, and ambient temperature.
    *   Not a substitute for laboratory testing.
    *   Requires regular calibration.
    *   Can be influenced by breath holding.
