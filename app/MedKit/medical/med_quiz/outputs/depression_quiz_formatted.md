# Medical Quiz: depression
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Question 1
**A 68-year-old male, Mr. Jones, presents to his primary care physician complaining of persistent sadness, feelings of hopelessness, and difficulty concentrating for the past six months. He reports a loss of interest in his hobbies, sleeping excessively, and experiencing fatigue. His wife reports he’s withdrawn and irritable, and he’s stopped attending his weekly poker game with friends. He denies suicidal thoughts but admits to feeling ‘like a burden’ on his family. Physical examination is unremarkable.  Initial screening with the PHQ-9 yields a score of 18. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial management step?**

**Options:**
A) Prescribe Sertraline 50mg daily and initiate cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
B) Order a complete blood count (CBC) and thyroid function tests to rule out underlying medical conditions.
C) Refer him to a psychiatrist for a formal psychiatric evaluation and potential initiation of antidepressant medication.
D) Encourage him to increase his social activities and engage in regular exercise to improve his mood.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The most appropriate initial step is referral to a psychiatrist. Mr. Jones presents with classic symptoms of depression, confirmed by a significant PHQ-9 score. While other options may be relevant later, a formal psychiatric evaluation is crucial for accurate diagnosis, consideration of complex factors (e.g., medication side effects, comorbid conditions), and initiation of appropriate treatment.  

**Why other options are incorrect:**
*   **A:** While antidepressants are often part of the treatment, initiating them without a thorough evaluation risks potential side effects and doesn’t address the underlying psychosocial factors contributing to his depression. CBT is a valuable adjunct but not the initial intervention.
*   **B:** While medical conditions can mimic depression, the patient’s reported symptoms and the PHQ-9 score strongly suggest a primary depressive disorder.  Ruling out medical causes is important but should follow psychiatric evaluation.
*   **D:** Lifestyle modifications can be beneficial as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, but they are unlikely to be sufficient for a moderate to severe depressive episode. Encouraging increased social activity without addressing his core feelings of hopelessness is unlikely to be effective.
