Okay, here’s a single multiple-choice question on migraine, adhering to all the specified requirements and guidelines for USMLE/MCCQE/UKMLA style questions.

```python
{
    'A': 'Administer intravenous metoclopramide for acute migraine relief.',
    'B': 'Order a complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate to rule out infection.',
    'C': 'Prescribe a prophylactic course of topiramate to reduce migraine frequency.',
    'D': 'Refer the patient to a neurologist for further investigation of potential secondary headache.'
}
```

**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**

*   **Why D is Correct:** This patient presents with a new onset of severe headache, accompanied by nausea and photophobia, in a young adult. While migraine is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation, it’s crucial to rule out secondary causes of headache, particularly in this scenario.  A neurologist’s evaluation is the most appropriate next step to investigate potential underlying conditions such as intracranial hemorrhage, tumor, or other neurological disorders that could mimic migraine.  This aligns with the principle of “first, do no harm” and ensures a thorough investigation before initiating migraine-specific treatment.

*   **Why A is Incorrect:** While intravenous metoclopramide can be effective for acute migraine relief, it doesn’t address the underlying cause or potential secondary headache.  It’s a symptomatic treatment and doesn’t rule out other possibilities.

*   **Why B is Incorrect:**  A CBC and ESR are useful in inflammatory conditions, but are not indicated as the *initial* step in evaluating a new-onset headache, especially when migraine is the most likely diagnosis.  They don't address the immediate need to rule out serious pathology.

*   **Why C is Incorrect:** Prophylactic topiramate is a reasonable long-term strategy for migraine prevention, but it’s premature to start this treatment without first investigating the cause of the headache.  It’s also not the most appropriate immediate management.

**Clinical Reasoning & Diversity Considerations:**

*   **Age:** The patient is a young adult (25 years old), which is a common age group for migraine onset.
*   **Presentation:** The presentation of a new-onset, severe headache with associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia) is characteristic of migraine, but necessitates a careful evaluation.
*   **Cognitive Skill:** This question tests the ability to differentiate between primary and secondary headaches, a critical skill in clinical decision-making. It requires application of knowledge regarding headache classification and diagnostic workup.
*   **Global Best Practices:** The answer aligns with current guidelines emphasizing the importance of ruling out secondary causes of headache, particularly in new-onset cases.
*   **Uniqueness & Diversity:** This scenario is distinct from common migraine management questions that focus solely on acute treatment. It emphasizes the initial diagnostic phase.
