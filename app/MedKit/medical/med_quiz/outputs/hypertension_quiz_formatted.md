# Medical Quiz: hypertension
**Difficulty:** easy

## Question 1
**A 62-year-old African-American male presents to the clinic complaining of worsening headaches, dizziness, and shortness of breath over the past month. He reports a family history of hypertension and obesity. His vital signs are: BP 160/95 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18 bpm, and SpO2 97% on room air. Physical examination reveals no remarkable findings. Initial laboratory tests show a normal serum creatinine and electrolytes. What is the MOST appropriate initial management step for this patient?**

**Options:**
A) Immediate initiation of a thiazide diuretic to rapidly lower blood pressure.
B) Prescription of an ACE inhibitor to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and reduce afterload.
C) Referral to a cardiologist for evaluation of potential cardiac involvement and initiation of lifestyle modifications including dietary changes and exercise.
D) Immediate placement of a transcutaneous continuous blood pressure monitoring device to accurately assess his blood pressure trends.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The most appropriate initial management for a patient with stage 1 hypertension, particularly one with risk factors like age, ethnicity, and family history, is a comprehensive approach that includes lifestyle modifications and referral to a specialist. Option C correctly identifies this approach.  Thiazide diuretics (A) are often used but don't address the underlying causes and can have significant side effects. ACE inhibitors (B) are a reasonable choice but lifestyle modifications are paramount. Continuous blood pressure monitoring (D) is useful for confirming diagnosis but doesn’t address the underlying cause or initiate treatment.  The focus here is on a holistic, evidence-based approach, aligning with global hypertension guidelines which prioritize lifestyle changes and referral for further management.
