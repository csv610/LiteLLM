Okay, here’s a single multiple-choice question on asthma, adhering to all the specified guidelines and requirements for quality and rigor.

```python
{
    'A': 'Initiate immediate administration of a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) via nebulizer to reverse bronchospasm and improve airflow.',
    'B': 'Prescribe a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to reduce airway inflammation and prevent future exacerbations.',
    'C': 'Order a complete blood count (CBC) and sputum culture to rule out bacterial infection as a contributing factor to the patient’s symptoms.',
    'D': 'Refer the patient to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and consideration of long-term bronchodilator therapy.'
}
# Correct Answer: A
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Correct Answer: A** – This is the most appropriate immediate management for a patient presenting with acute asthma symptoms. The patient’s presentation (wheezing, shortness of breath, and history of asthma) indicates an acute bronchospastic response.  SABAs (like albuterol) rapidly relax airway smooth muscle, providing immediate relief of airflow obstruction. This aligns with current international guidelines for acute asthma exacerbations.

*   **Distractor B: ‘Prescribe a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to reduce airway inflammation and prevent future exacerbations.’** – While ICS are a cornerstone of asthma *management*, they are not the immediate response to an acute exacerbation.  ICS take several days to have a significant effect.  This option represents a preventative strategy, not immediate treatment. It’s a plausible consideration for long-term control, but not the best next step in this acute situation.

*   **Distractor C: ‘Order a complete blood count (CBC) and sputum culture to rule out bacterial infection as a contributing factor to the patient’s symptoms.’** –  While infection can *trigger* asthma exacerbations, the patient’s history of asthma suggests an allergic or inflammatory etiology is more likely.  Ordering a CBC and sputum culture is not the priority in the acute setting; it’s a diagnostic step that might be considered *after* initial treatment has been initiated and the patient’s response is assessed. This represents a different diagnostic pathway.

*   **Distractor D: ‘Refer the patient to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and consideration of long-term bronchodilator therapy.’** – Referral to a pulmonologist is appropriate for complex or persistent asthma, but it’s not the *best next step* in the initial management of an acute exacerbation.  The immediate goal is to stabilize the patient’s breathing, and SABAs provide that. This represents a delayed, longer-term management approach.

**Clinical Reasoning & Key Considerations:**

*   **Acute Asthma Exacerbation:** The patient’s symptoms (wheezing, dyspnea) are highly suggestive of an asthma exacerbation, characterized by airway bronchospasm.
*   **Rapid Relief:** The primary goal in an acute exacerbation is to rapidly reverse bronchospasm and restore airflow.
*   **SABAs as First-Line:** Short-acting beta-agonists are the fastest-acting bronchodilators and are the mainstay of initial treatment.
*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While other conditions could cause similar symptoms, asthma is the most likely diagnosis given the patient’s history.

**UNIQUENESS & DIVERSITY:** This question presents a common clinical scenario (asthma exacerbation) but focuses on the *immediate* management strategy, testing the ability to prioritize interventions based on the presenting symptoms. The distractors represent different aspects of asthma management (long-term control, diagnostic testing, specialist referral), ensuring semantic differentiation. The patient is a typical adult presentation of asthma.
