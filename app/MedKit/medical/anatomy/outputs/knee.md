## The Knee: An Anatomical Overview

The knee is a complex synovial joint, permitting flexion, extension, and limited rotation. Its function is critical for locomotion and weight-bearing. Anatomically, it’s defined by its articulation between the femur, tibia, and patella.

**I. Articular Surfaces & Bones:**

*   **Femur (Thigh Bone):** The proximal femur contributes to the knee joint through the following:
    *   **Femoral Condyle:** The rounded prominence articulating with the tibia. It’s crucial for patellar tracking and stability.
    *   **Trochanteric Crest:**  A ridge projecting laterally, involved in the attachment of muscles.
    *   **Linea Aspera:** A prominent ridge running down the posterior femur, serving as an attachment site for numerous muscles.
*   **Tibia (Shin Bone):** The major weight-bearing bone of the lower leg.
    *   **Medial Tibial Plateau:** The sloping surface articulating with the femur.
    *   **Tibial Condyles (Medial & Lateral):**  Rounded projections that articulate with the femoral condyles, forming the primary weight-bearing surfaces. The lateral condyle is more rounded and mobile than the medial.
    *   **Intercondylar Fossa:** A shallow groove located between the condyles, housing the menisci.
*   **Patella (Kneecap):** A sesamoid bone embedded in the quadriceps tendon, acting as a lever for muscle action and providing protection for the knee joint.
    *   **Trochlear Surface:** Articulates with the femoral condyle.
    *   **Coronal Surface:** Articulates with the tibia.
    *   **Anterior Tubercle:**  An attachment site for the quadriceps tendon.
    *   **Posterior Tubercle:**  An attachment site for the quadriceps tendon and a key landmark for assessing patellar tracking.



**II. Intra-articular Structures:**

*   **Menisci:**  Crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous pads located within the intercondylar fossa of the tibia. There are two menisci:
    *   **Medial Meniscus:** Larger and more common, primarily responsible for load distribution and stability. It has a more complex shape and a prominent coronary groove.
    *   **Lateral Meniscus:** Smaller and less fibrocartilaginous, primarily involved in load distribution.
*   **Articular Capsule:** A fibrous capsule enclosing the knee joint, providing stability and containing synovial fluid.
    *   **Lateral Capsule:**  Attached to the femur and tibia, providing resistance to lateral movement.
    *   **Medial Capsule:**  Attached to the tibia, providing resistance to medial movement.
*   **Synovial Fluid:** Lubricates the joint, reducing friction and providing nutrients to the articular cartilage.



**III. Ligaments:**  Crucial for knee stability.

*   **Cranial Cruciate Ligament (CCL):**  Crosses anteriorly from the intercondylar fossa of the tibia to the lateral femoral condyle.  Crucial for resisting anterior translation of the tibia on the femur.
*   **Caudal Cruciate Ligament (CCG):**  Similar to the CCL but runs posteriorly. It’s often incomplete and functionally insignificant.
*   **Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL):**  Runs along the medial side of the tibia, resisting valgus stress (force pushing the knee inward).
*   **Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL):**  Runs along the lateral side of the tibia, resisting varus stress (force pushing the knee outward).
*   **Annular Ligaments:**  Fibrous rings surrounding the tibial spine, providing additional stability.



**IV. Blood Supply, Innervation & Lymphatic Drainage:**

*   **Blood Supply:**
    *   **Posterior Knee:** Supplied by the posterior tibial artery, which branches into the fibular artery.
    *   **Anterior Knee:** Supplied by the anterior femoral artery, which branches into the rectus artery.
*   **Innervation:** Primarily by the saphenous nerve (medial knee) and the tibial nerve (lateral knee).
*   **Lymphatic Drainage:** Drains into the superficial and deep lymphatic vessels, ultimately emptying into the inguinal lymph nodes.

**V. Embryological Development:**

The knee joint develops from the lower limb bud. The articular surfaces form through endochondral ossification, while the ligaments develop from mesenchyme. The menisci arise from the metaphyseal regions of the femur and tibia.



**Clinical Significance:**  The knee is a frequently injured joint, susceptible to ligament sprains, meniscal tears, and osteoarthritis. Understanding the complex anatomy is paramount for accurate diagnosis, surgical planning, and rehabilitation. Variations in meniscal shape, ligament size, and patellar tracking are frequently encountered and can significantly impact clinical presentation.
