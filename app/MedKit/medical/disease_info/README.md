# Disease Information Generator

A command-line tool that generates medical information reports for specific diseases using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.

## Overview

The Disease Information Generator utilizes the `LiteClient` library to interface with LLMs (defaulting to `ollama/gemma3`). It produces detailed reports covering various aspects of a disease, including pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and patient considerations.

## Features

- **Reports:** Generates information on:
  - Disease Identity & Background (Definition, Pathophysiology, Etiology)
  - Epidemiology & Risk Factors
  - Clinical Presentation (Symptoms, Signs)
  - Diagnosis (Criteria, Differential Diagnosis)
  - Management (Treatment, Prevention, Prognosis)
  - Research & Special Populations
- **Structured Output:** Option to generate strictly structured data (JSON) validated against Pydantic models.
- **Customizable Models:** Supports different LLM backends via configuration.
- **CLI Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface with logging and file output management.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. This module relies on the `lite` package located in the parent directory.

1.  **Dependencies:** Ensure all project dependencies (including `pydantic` and `lite` requirements) are installed.
2.  **Environment:** Set up your LLM provider credentials if using a non-local model (e.g., API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., if configured in `LiteClient`).

## Usage

Run the tool from the command line using `disease_info_cli.py`.

### Basic Command

Generate a text report for a specific disease:

```bash
python disease_info_cli.py -i "Type 2 Diabetes"
```

### Advanced Usage

Generate a structured JSON report, specify a custom output directory, and set the model:

```bash
python disease_info_cli.py -i "Pneumonia" -s -d "./my_reports" -m "ollama/llama3"
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Flag | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Disease** | `-i`, `--disease` | **Required.** Name of the disease to generate info for. | N/A |
| **Output Directory** | `-d`, `--output-dir` | Directory to save the generated report. | `outputs` |
| **Model** | `-m`, `--model` | LLM model identifier to use. | `ollama/gemma3` |
| **Structured** | `-s`, `--structured` | Output as structured JSON (validates against Pydantic schema). | `False` |
| **Verbosity** | `-v`, `--verbosity` | Logging level (0=CRITICAL to 4=DEBUG). | `2` (WARNING) |

## Output Structure

### Text Mode (Default)
Generates a markdown-formatted text file containing a comprehensive medical summary.

### Structured Mode (`-s`)
Generates a JSON file adhering to the `DiseaseInfoModel` schema, encompassing:
- **Identity:** Names, ICD-10 codes.
- **Background:** Definitions, pathophysiology.
- **Epidemiology:** Prevalence, incidence, risk factors.
- **Clinical:** Symptoms, signs, natural history.
- **Diagnosis:** Criteria, tests, imaging.
- **Management:** Treatments, prevention.
- **Research:** Current studies, advancements.
