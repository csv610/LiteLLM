- **Evidence Evaluation**: Analyzes the strength of supporting evidence and identifies potential factual errors.
- **Structured Output**: Support for Pydantic-validated JSON output for easy integration into other systems.
- **Detailed Context**: Provides subject area classification, key terms, and potential reasons for common misconceptions.
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for individual statement analysis.
- **Markdown Reports**: Generates human-readable analysis reports.

## Project Structure

- `medical_facts_checker_cli.py`: Command-line interface entry point.
- `medical_facts_checker.py`: Core logic for statement analysis and LLM interaction.
- `medical_facts_checker_models.py`: Pydantic data models for structured output.
- `medical_facts_checker_prompts.py`: Expert-curated system and user prompts.
- `assets/facts_list.json`: A collection of verifiable medical facts for testing and reference.

## Installation

This project requires a Python environment and access to the `lite` LLM client library (located in the parent directory).

1. Ensure dependencies are met:
   ```bash
   pip install pydantic
   ```
2. Configure your LLM environment (e.g., Ollama or Gemini) as required by the `lite` client.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Analyze a statement and print the results to the console:

```bash
python medical_facts_checker_cli.py -i "Antibiotics act against bacteria but not viruses."
```

### Structured Output

Generate a structured JSON analysis using a specific model:

```bash
python medical_facts_checker_cli.py -i "The human heart has five chambers." --structured --model "ollama/gemma3"
```

### Save Results to File

```bash
python medical_facts_checker_cli.py -i "Insulin lowers blood glucose." -o insulin_analysis.json
```

## Analysis Model

The checker provides a comprehensive analysis including:

- **Classification**: Fact or Fiction.
- **Confidence Level**: High, Medium, or Low (with percentage).
- **Factual Support**: Supporting sources, evidence types, and verification methods.
- **Fiction Indicators**: Red flags, factual errors, and lack of evidence.
- **Context**: Subject area, key terms, and assumptions.
- **Plain Language Explanation**: Why the statement is classified as it is.
