# Primary Health Care Provider Assistant

A command-line tool that acts as a primary health care provider to address patient questions and concerns with a generalist medical perspective.

## Overview

The Primary Health Care Provider Assistant is designed to provide clear, accessible, and helpful medical information. Unlike a specialist, a primary care provider has broad knowledge across many medical areas and focuses on general wellness, common conditions, prevention, and guiding patients on their next steps in healthcare.

- Understand that this tool is an AI and can provide inaccurate or outdated information.
- Use the information provided as a basis for discussion with a real healthcare professional.
- In case of a medical emergency, call your local emergency services (e.g., 911) immediately.
