Natural language processing (NLP) is a key field in artificial intelligence. It involves **text analysis**, *machine learning*, and deep neural networks.

### Key Concepts

- Tokenization: Breaking text into words
- [Named Entity Recognition](https://example.com)
- Sentiment Analysis

## Code Example
